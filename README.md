# Nord Writer

A [Nord color scheme](https://nordtheme.com) based theme for distraction free writing in [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/). 

- The theme hides most UI elements. The status bar and file pane are shown on hover.
- If you have the Action Bar open, it will show the word and character counts and hide everything else.
